  <h3>There is a fun way to remember the most important points in forest preservation called TREES which means...</h3>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Teach</b> others about the importance of the environment and how they can help save rainforests.</li>
    <li><b>Restore</b> damaged ecosystems by planting trees on land where forests have been cut down.</li>
    <li><b>Encourage</b> people to live in a way that doesn't hurt the environment.</li>
    <li><b>Establish</b> parks to protect rainforests and wildlife.</li>
    <li><b>Support</b> companies that operate in ways that minimize damage to the environment.</li>
  </ul><br>
  <h3>Here are a few things you can also do to help.</h3>
  <br><ul>
    <li>Make a conscious effort to share information with others (friends at school and family members) on deforestation and its' effects. Some of your friends may laugh at you and say it is silly to think that you can solve problems like this. But that is OK, things work better when responsible people donâ€™t give up. Stand up for what you believe in.</li>
    <li>Join organizations, forest-preservation societies, and pressure groups that aim to help preserve the rest of our natural resources. When more people work together, the impact is greater.</li>
    <li>reduce the use of artificial items, recycle more and re-use items. Wood, paper, plastics and many other things we use every day at home can be linked to natural resources being destroyed. This means that if we all recycle more, there will be less dependence on the environment (and trees). It also means that companies and governments will import fewer raw-materials from the forest regions of the world.</li>
