    <h1><u>What is Climate Change?</u></h1>
    <p>Plants absorb Carbon Dioxide CO2 (a greenhouse gas) from the atmosphere and use it to produce food (carbohydrates, fats, and proteins that makeup trees). In return, it gives off Oxygen. Destroying the forests means CO2 will remain in the atmosphere and in addition, destroyed vegetation will give off more CO2 stored in them as they decompose. This will alter the climate of that region. Cool climates may get a lot hotter and hot places may get a lot cooler.</p>
