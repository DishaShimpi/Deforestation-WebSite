      <h1><u><b>#Solutions to Deforestation</b></u></h1></br>
      <p>Trees play a vital role in protecting our environment in several ways. Fewer forests mean that the sustainability of our planet earth is endangered. So far, there are actions and measures that are being undertaken to curtail deforestation, a move towards saving our natural environment and repairing the damage that has been caused for more than a century. The quickest solution would be to just stop the cutting down of trees. Nonetheless, a more workable solution is use of proper forest management strategies to ensure the environment is not disturbed.</p><br>
      <h3>Some of these strategies include:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Green Business</li>
        <p>Green business concerns re-use and recycling. Green methods of production and utilization of resources can immeasurably reduce deforestation. Particularly, it’s the focus on re-using items, reducing the use of artificial items, and recycling more items. Paper, plastics, and wood are linked to the destruction of forests and other natural resources.</p>
        <li>Eco-forestry</li>
        <p> Eco-forestry is a move on saving the worlds forest. It acknowledges that sometimes, the use of trees for various human activities or reasons can be inevitable. Per se, eco-forestry underscores the need of cutting down trees in an environmentally friendly manner.</p>
        <li>Law and Regulations</li>
        <p>Due to the nature and extent of forest destruction, efforts to stop the human activities can be complemented by laws and regulation at governmental and organizational levels. As much as people increasingly become aware of deforestation consequences, some people focus more on the immediate economic gains at the expense of the long-term environmental damage.</p>
        <li>Community Forestry</li>
        <p>Community forestry is whereby local communities together with their local government and other local organizations such as schools, corporate, and universities join hands to start localized tree planting programs and management of their local forests. </p>
        <li>.Replanting (Reforestation)</li>
        <p>eplanting or tree planting utilizes almost the same aspect as community forestry. However, it entirely focuses of replanting, a feature commonly known as reforestation. Reforestation is the restoration or replanting of forests that have been reduced by fire or felling. It requires an ongoing process and should not be viewed as a onetime thing.</p>
        <li>Sensitization and Educative Campaigns</li>
        <p>Deforestation can also be counteracted through awareness and sensitization. Sensitization and educative campaigns can be a simple but a more workable solution. Initiating awareness creation champagnes makes it easy for people to detect the causes, effects, and ways of counteracting deforestation.</p>
        <li>Joint Organizations</li>
        <p>Conservation, wildlife, rainforest, and nature protection agencies among other environmental programs can join together with a common goal of preserving, restoring, and protecting forests to ensure permanence of the world’s natural resources. </p>
        <li>Land Use Planning</li>
        <p>Cities and urban centers continue to grow day after day as more and more people claim their share of living in cities and the urban areas. Agricultural practices also continue to expand as farmers and consumer demands call for better productivity and quality food products respectively. As a result, the urban sprawl and agricultural expansion have kept on clearing forests to create more room for their respective activities.</p>
