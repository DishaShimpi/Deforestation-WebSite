    <h1><u>What is Deforestation?</u></h1></br>
    <h3>Stop deforestation to save the nation from pollution.</h3></br>
    <p>Deforestation, clearance, clearcutting or clearing is the removal of a forest or stand of trees from land which is then converted to a non-forest use. Deforestation can involve conversation of forest land to farms, ranches, or urban use. The most concentrated deforestation occurs in tropical rainforests.
    Deforestation is when forests are destroyed by cutting trees(logging) and not replanting them. Sometimes deforestion happens when people change lands into farms, ranches and cities. The most common cause for deforestation is obtaining wood and fuel. This destroy the habitat of many animals, leading to their death.</p>
